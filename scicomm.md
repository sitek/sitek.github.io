# Science communication
Science requires communication—our work only has an impact when it's shared with others. Starting in my PhD, I have been involved in science communication focusing on both general and scientific audiences.

## Teaching
**Northwestern University CSD 550-3: Communicating Science.** Why do we share our research? How do we best communicate research with different audiences? What are best practices in oral, written, visual, and multimedia communication? This course helps Northwestern PhD students craft their own scientific narrative and develop communication skills for sharing their work with diverse audiences.
