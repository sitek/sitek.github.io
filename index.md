## Imaging the human subcortical auditory system
I'm a neuroscientist studying subcortical structures in the human brain that process sensory stimuli.
I am a [research assistant professor](https://communication.northwestern.edu/faculty/kevin-sitek.html) in the [SoundBrain Lab](https://soundbrainlab.northwestern.edu) at Northwestern University's [Roxelyn and Richard Pepper Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders](https://communication.northwestern.edu/academics/communication-sciences-and-disorders/). 

My work is funded by the NIH through an NIDCD Early Career Research Award (R21DC022906), "Auditory–motor interactions in neural processing and the frequency-following response," (2025–2028) and a Mentored Career Development Award (K01DC019421) entitled "Investigating human non-lemniscal inferior colliculus contributions to auditory learning with 7T MRI" (2022–2027).

You can find me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/sitek.bsky.social) and [GitHub](https://github.com/sitek), among other places.

I'm also a member of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping Communication Committee, serving as Committee Chair in 2023–24. I previously produced the [OHBM Neurosalience podcast](https://anchor.fm/ohbm), and contributed to [OHBM blog posts](https://www.ohbmbrainmappingblog.com/contributors.html).
