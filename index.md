## Imaging the human sensory brainstem
I'm a neuroscientist studying subcortical structures in the human brain that process sensory stimuli.
I'm currently a postdoctoral associate at [Baylor College of Medicine](https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/kevin-sitek-36931).

You can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/krsitek), [GitHub](github.com/sitek), and on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kevin_Sitek).

I'm also the [Social Media and Communications Manager](https://twitter.com/OHBM_Trainees) of the OHBM [Studentâ€“Postdoc Special Interest Group](https://www.ohbmtrainees.com/).
